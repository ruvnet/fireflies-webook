/architect fully implement README.md init-prompt.md including all files, folders, functions, configurations.

To improve the "/architect fully implement README.md init-prompt.md including all files, folders, functions, configurations." prompt using the SPARC framework, we can structure it as follows:

```
Using the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) framework, fully implement the project described in README.md and init-prompt.md. Please follow these steps:

1. Specification:
   - Analyze README.md and init-prompt.md to extract all project requirements, objectives, and constraints.
   - Define clear functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Outline user scenarios and use cases.
   - Establish UI/UX guidelines if applicable.

2. Pseudocode:
   - Develop a high-level pseudocode outline for the main components and functions described in the project.
   - Include comments explaining the logic and flow of the pseudocode.

3. Architecture:
   - Design the system architecture, including all necessary components, modules, and their interactions.
   - Specify the technology stack, frameworks, and tools to be used.
   - Create a folder structure for the project, including all necessary files and configurations.
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the architectural decisions.

4. Refinement:
   - Iterate on the initial design, optimizing for performance, scalability, and maintainability.
   - Address any potential issues or challenges identified in the previous steps.
   - Refine the pseudocode into actual code implementations for key functions and components.

5. Completion:
   - Provide a complete implementation of all files, folders, functions, and configurations as specified in the README.md and init-prompt.md.
   - Include necessary documentation, such as inline comments, function docstrings, and a updated README.md.
   - Outline any testing strategies, deployment procedures, and maintenance considerations.

Throughout this process, please act as a reflective architect and editor by justifying decisions, considering alternatives, and discussing potential challenges and solutions. Use tools like Perplexity for research when needed, and document your findings and decisions in markdown files.

Please present your final output in a structured format, organizing all content in appropriate markdown files and code files within the specified project structure.
```

This improved prompt incorporates the key aspects of the SPARC framework, ensuring a comprehensive and structured approach to implementing the project. It guides the AI through each step of the process, from initial specification to final completion, while encouraging reflection and justification of decisions along the way.
